### Introduction:
The visibility of a scientific journal is directly linked to its presence in recognized indexing databases, such as SciELO, PubMed, DOAJ, Redalyc, and Scopus. Indexing ensures that published articles reach a broader audience and have greater academic impact.

### Benefits of indexing:
- Increased visibility and citations;
- International recognition;
